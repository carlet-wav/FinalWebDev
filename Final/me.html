    <div class="para1">Hey there, I'm Carley Thompson. On top of being a sound designer from rural Missouri, I'm also a dancer and choreographer. </div>

    <div class="para2">My interest for sound design started around my middle school years, watching my older brother play through various games and joining in. When one day it just clicked that "I want work on games someday."</div>

    <div class="para3">Dancing was something I started at an even younger age, finding that moving fluidly to music of various types felt good. I've never been trained, or have had classes of any sort but it never stopped me from finding my own style and pursuing it further. I can learn choreography and create them to any style of music. Though my main types are hip-hop, freestyle, and modern/show. 
    </div>

    <div class="para4">Some of my technical skills include working in DAW Pro Tools, game engine Unity, middleware Wwise, and programming language C#.</div>
